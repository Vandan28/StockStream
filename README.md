## Key Components
- **Data Simulation**: Utilizes historical datasets to mimic real-time stock market data streams.
- **ETL Pipeline**: Constructs an end-to-end pipeline for data extraction, transformation, and loading.
- **Technologies Used**:
  - **Apache Kafka**: For streaming data ingestion.
  - **AWS S3**: For scalable data storage.
  - **AWS Glue**: For data cataloging and ETL operations.
  - **AWS Athena**: For SQL-based querying and analysis.

## Features
- Simulated real-time data ingestion and processing.
- Automated data cataloging and querying.
- Efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms.
